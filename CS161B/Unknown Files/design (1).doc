 The major that has the highest salary is PETROLEUM-ENGINEERING with a salary of $110000



===========================================================
DESIGN:

a) Inputs
- Read from a file "stem.txt"
- MAX = 51 characters
-----------------------------------------------------------
b) Outputs
- write the results to "stemout.txt" file
- The program outputs the percentage of men and women in each major using the ratioCalc function
- The program outputs highest salary as well using calculateOtherStatistic function
-----------------------------------------------------------
c) Calculations
 N/A
-----------------------------------------------------------
d) Pseudocode
Declare constant MAX = 51

Define function prototypes:
- bool openFile(ifstream& inFile, string fileName)
- void ratioCalc(ifstream& inFile, ofstream& fileName)
- void calculateOtherStatistic(ifstream& inFile, ofstream& outFile)

Define the main function:
    Declare variables: ifstream inFile, ofstream outFile, char highestSalary[MAX], int maxSalary = 0
    IF file isn't open from "stem.txt"
          DISPLAY "Error opening file." << endl;
    END IF
    CALL outFile.open("stemout.txt") for output
    Call ratioCalc function passing inFile and outFile
    Call calculateOtherStatistic function passing inFile and outFile
    Close "stem.txt" and "stemout.txt" files
    Return 0

CALL FUNCTION openFile:
    Declare parameters: ifstream& inFile, string fileName
    Open fileName using inFile
    If file opening fails, return false; otherwise, return true

CALL FUNCTION ratioCalc:
    Declare variables: char major[MAX], char discardLine[MAX], int men, women, total, intDiscard
    double menPerc, womenPerc
    Write headers to outFile and console
    Ignore the header line in the input file
    Read data from the input file until the end of the file:
        Calculate men percentage and women percentage
        Write major, men percentage, and women percentage to outFile
    Clear the end-of-file flag and reset the file pointer to the beginning of the input file

Define function calculateOtherStatistic:
    Declare variables: char major[MAX], char discardLine[MAX], char topMajor[MAX], int salary, int intDiscard, maxSalary = 0
    Ignore the header line in the input file
    Read data from the input file until the end of the file:
        Read major and salary from the file
        If salary is greater than maxSalary, update maxSalary and topMajor
    Write the major with the highest salary to outFile
